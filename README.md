# PINN for Solving a First-Order ODE

This project serves as a foundational example of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) implemented in PyTorch. It demonstrates how to train a neural network to solve a simple first-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), `du/dt = cos(2œÄt)`, with a given initial condition, `u(0) = 1`. The goal is to approximate the unknown function `u(t)` by encoding the differential equation directly into the network's loss function.

## üìú Project Description

Physics-Informed Neural Networks are a class of neural networks that learn to solve differential equations by satisfying the physical laws they represent. Instead of relying solely on data, a PINN's loss function includes terms that measure how well the network's output satisfies the governing equations and boundary conditions. This project provides a clear, step-by-step implementation for a basic ODE, making it an excellent starting point for understanding the core principles of PINNs.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Neural Network Approximator**: A simple feedforward neural network serves as a universal function approximator for the solution `u(t)`.
-   **Physics-Informed Loss**: The custom loss function combines two components:
    1.  The residual from the ODE (`du/dt - cos(2œÄt)`).
    2.  The error from the initial condition (`u(0) - 1`).
-   **Automatic Differentiation**: Leverages PyTorch's `autograd` feature to compute the derivative `du/dt` required for the ODE residual, eliminating the need for manual numerical differentiation.
-   **Validation**: Compares the PINN's prediction against the exact analytical solution to visually assess its accuracy.

## üíª Code Structure

The entire implementation is contained within a single Python script (`main.py`) for simplicity and clarity. The key steps are:

1.  **PINN Class Definition**: A `torch.nn.Module` defines the neural network architecture.
2.  **Data Generation**: `torch.linspace` is used to create collocation points where the ODE will be enforced.
3.  **Loss Function (`pinn_loss`)**: A function that calculates the combined ODE and initial condition loss.
4.  **Training Loop**: A standard training loop that uses an optimizer (like SGD or Adam) to minimize the loss function and update the network's weights.
5.  **Results Visualization**: After training, the model's output is plotted against the true solution using Matplotlib.
